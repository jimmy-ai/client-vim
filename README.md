## Pre-installation

Your Vim needs to be compiled with `clientserver`. To find out about that,
run `vim --version`. If you see `+clientserver`, you're good to go. If you see
`-clientserver`, you're not.

If you need to install Vim again, on the Mac run:

```
brew install vim --with-client-server
```
